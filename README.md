Shapeshifter Tips + Tricks
==========================

- You can modulate the decay for all presets using the MODB bus. To enable this, press the DETUNE/DCAY button twice. 
  This will map the DECAY setting to the MODB signal. You can either use the MODB input or just play with the MODB 
  knob to vary the DECAY values while stepping through the presets.

- When you press SAVE while in preset step mode it will just take you out of step mode. You have to press SAVE again. 
  This will give you the confirmation display (Yes or No). Select Yes or No and then press SAVE once more.

- With osc2 in LFO mode, turn up the MODA attenuator knob. With nothing plugged into the MODA jack this phase modulates 
  osc2 with osc1, and makes out1 and out2 into a nice stereo mix. 

- Turn QUANT on and play with the RATIO knob to get nice FM sounds with INT. FM turned up. 

- Try different MULTI settings with the wavebank set to one of the Chip or 2Tone banks. 
  Play with (or modulate) the Shape controls. 

- With osc1 set to a sine wave (Basic1 bank, shape1 fully ccw) use an envelope to modulate the TILT parameter. This gives a nice acoustic bass. 

- When playing with the preset morph or stepping, make presets that are either very similar to each other, or very different from each other. 

- Different chords are cool when using preset morphing. 

- Reverse sync can make harsh sounds smoother 

- Hold sync gives nice gating effects 

- Put osc2 in lfo mode and use out2 as a modulator for everything and anything. 

- With osc2 in lfo mode use the ring mode combo mode to get cool envelope effects 
  (good in perc mode - the lfo is synced to the attack so osc2 becomes another envelope for osc1) 

- With OSC2 in LFO mode, patch it into Mod A while in Vocoder mode. Activate Chord mode. 
  Set the OSC2 Multi value to something greater than 1 and play with the ratio to get a nice complex modulation source. 
  It can sound even better if OSC1 is also in LFO mode. 

- With OSC2 in LFO mode patch it into the FOLD input. Now adjust the FOLD amount and take the output back to the FM1 (or any other mod input). 
  It creates really complex modulation that can vary in interesting ways depending on the amount of folding. 
  Some of the LFO wavebanks work really well for this. 

- With percussive mode active you get an overall amplitude decay on OUT1. You can use OSC2 in LFO mode as a second envelope if you select wavetablebank:LFO3. 
  It will cycle so make sure to dial in a frequency that works with your decay value of the percussive envelope. Patch OSC2 into FM1 to modulate the pitch. 
  Use a trigger at the sync input to trigger and sync both percussive envelopes (pitch and amplitude). 
  It makes great kick drums which you can morph into other percussive sounds.
